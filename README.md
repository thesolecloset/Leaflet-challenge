The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.


# For this challenge I did the following:

## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

* Imported the data from USGS GeoJSON Feed.
* Used leaflet to create the map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude & latitude.
* Color coded data markers that show the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth.
* Created popups that provided information about the earthquakes when clicked.
* Created a legend that provided context for the depths on the map


* Deploy your app to GitHub Pages and posted link to page - https://thesolecloset.github.io/Leaflet-challenge/
